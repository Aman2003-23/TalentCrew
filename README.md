#TalentCrew

TalentCrew is an advanced AI-powered recruitment automation platform designed to streamline the hiring process. Built with Python and Streamlit, it features four intelligent agents working in harmony: a Sourcing Agent that discovers and extracts candidate profiles from various sources, a Screening Agent that evaluates resumes using NLP to match candidates with job requirements, an Engagement Agent that handles automated candidate communications, and a Scheduling Agent that manages interview scheduling. The platform includes a comprehensive dashboard that displays real-time recruitment metrics, agent status monitoring, and pipeline visualization. It leverages ChromaDB for efficient data storage and LangChain for AI orchestration, particularly in its built-in HR chatbot that assists talent acquisition managers. The system uses Plotly for data visualization and features a modern web interface running on port 5000. The architecture is modular and event-driven, with each agent operating independently while maintaining synchronized workflow states through a central database. This makes TalentCrew a powerful tool for modern recruitment teams, automating repetitive tasks while maintaining high-quality candidate engagement through AI-driven interactions.
